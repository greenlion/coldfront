RAPID Secondary Engine Test Suite
==================================

This test suite validates the RAPID secondary storage engine functionality.

Test Files:
-----------
- basic.test: Basic table creation, loading, and querying
- binlog_replication.test: Tests binlog-based incremental replication
- system_variables.test: Tests RAPID configuration variables
- aggregates.test: Tests aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.)
- decimal.test: Tests DECIMAL type support with various precisions and scales
- unsupported_types.test: Verifies GEOMETRY and other unsupported types are rejected
- binary_blob.test: Tests binary BLOB/TEXT data handling with hex encoding

Running Tests:
--------------
# Run all RAPID tests:
./mtr suite/rapid

# Run a specific test:
./mtr suite/rapid/basic

# Run with verbose output:
./mtr --verbose suite/rapid

Configuration:
--------------
The suite.opt file configures:
- Binary logging enabled (required for incremental replication)
- ROW binlog format (required for proper row-level replication)

Prerequisites:
--------------
- RAPID plugin must be loaded via LD_PRELOAD
- Binary logging must be enabled
- DuckDB library must be available

Expected Behavior:
------------------
- Tables created with SECONDARY_ENGINE=RAPID offload queries to DuckDB
- ALTER TABLE SECONDARY_LOAD copies data from InnoDB to DuckDB
- INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations are replicated via binlog consumer
- Aggregate queries execute in DuckDB and return correct results
